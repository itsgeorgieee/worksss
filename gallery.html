       <h2>On Wednesday</h2>
       <div><img src="program.jpeg"></div>
        It all started on a Wednesday evening when I started my freeCodeCamp journey.
        It was a bit confusing when I started but along the way I used to it. I had 
        over a hundred points on my profile that day and I was extremely happy. The 
        following week , we had a scrum meeting and I shared my experience with my 
        lecturer. One day, my lecturer, Mr. Owusu, introduced an exciting new initiative.
        <h2>Scrum meeting</h2>

        He announced that we would have weekly scrum meetings to discuss our progress with external learning platforms like FreeCodeCamp.
        I was thrilled to share my progress.During our first scrum meeting, I presented my journey so far. 
        “I’ve completed the HTML and CSS modules, and I’m halfway through JavaScript,” I said. Mr. Owusu was impressed.
        “That’s fantastic,” he responded, “Tell me more about the projects you’ve completed.”
        I explained how I had built a personal portfolio webpage and a responsive web design project.
        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <div><img src="project.jpeg"></div>
        Mr. Owusu encouraged me to continue pushing myself and suggested I start working on the JavaScript algorithms and data structures projects.
         We set goals for the next meeting, including completing a few more projects and figuring out how to present my work to the world.
        In the following weeks, I dedicated myself to FreeCodeCamp, tackling each challenge with enthusiasm. 
        I built a random quote machine, a weather app, and even a simple calculator.
         Each project taught me something new and helped me improve my skills.
